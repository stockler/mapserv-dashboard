    # Innovation Layer / Bi-Modal
    Mapserver Web API, Designed to be the central point of access to all layers services serving by WMS using MapServer.
    
    # Resource Hierarchy
    
    The resources are in part independent of the user browsing them

    All return application/json as Response media-type and all accept only application/json as request media-type.
    
    # Hypermedia
    
    The usual form of each response is to include a links array with a number of objects of the form:
    
    **href**: the url
    
    **rel**:  the meaning of the url (prev, next, self, etc.)
    
    **label**: UI label
    
    ```json
        "links": [
            {
                "href": "http://prod-dashboard-mapserv.herokuapp.com/rest/v1/maps?pageIndex=28&pageSize=7",
                "rel": "next"
            },
            {
                "href": "http://prod-dashboard-mapserv.herokuapp.com/rest/v1/maps?pageIndex=14&pageSize=7",
                "rel": "prev"
            },
            {
                "href": "http://prod-dashboard-mapserv.herokuapp.com/rest/v1/maps",
                "rel": "self"
            }
        ]
    ```
    
    If the response is a collection object, it will have a links array at the root and for each workspace in the maps array.
    
    ```json
      "collection": {
        "size": 7,
        "maps": [
          {              
              "name": "bacias",
              "links": [
                  {
                      "href": "http://prod-dashboard-mapserv.herokuapp.com/rest/v1/maps/bacias",
                      "rel": "self"
                  }
              ]
          },
          { ...
    ```
